**From Tokyo to Ulaanbaatar: A Multilingual Engineer Bridging Cultures Through Code**

After a decade in Japan, I returned to Mongolia to pursue my goal of becoming a Web Developer. I enrolled in IO Institute's intensive program, seeking a focused environment where I could fully dedicate myself to learning.

Living in Japan for 10 years made me more fluent in Japanese than my native Mongolian. This fluency lets me tap into Japan's rich technical resources—I consume nearly all my learning materials and documentation in Japanese, supplemented by English. With a global mindset and local drive, I'm committed to becoming a world-class developer who navigates complex technical landscapes across languages.
